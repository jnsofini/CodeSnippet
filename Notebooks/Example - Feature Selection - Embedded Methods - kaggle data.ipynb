    "# **Feature Selection**\n",
    "Here we explore methodologies to identify which features are useful provide a higher predictive power to the model. Given a dataset, a model trained on it can depend on features directly on derived features. How do we tell wich features are the most useful? Multiple approaches exist, which are based on simple ideas of univariate analysis to complex multivariate analysis. In univariate analysis we look at how a single feature contribute to the model. Although useful, it does have pitfalls as some features are better together. In multivariate analysis we can tell which features perform well and more importantly which perform well together. Various techniques exist driven differentiated by how information is extracted. When data contains label like the case here, we use supervised techniques, nevetheless, unsupervised techniques can be used for unlabelled data.\n",

    "As noted in the [source page](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/10/feature-selection-techniques-in-machine-learning/), these techniques can be classified as follows\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Wrapper methods:** With a specific learning algorithm, these methose can perform a greedy search of the best feature by fitting models with possible subsets of features, assessing their quality by learning and evaluating a classifier with that feature subset. \n",
    "- **Embedded methods:** Here they aim to combine the power of both filters and wrapper while maintaining reasonable computational cost.\n",
    "- **Hybrid method:** Hybrid methods basically select features via a global transformation reduces the data to a desided number of dimensions. The new features can bear little or no resemblance to the initial features.\n",

    "## 4 Embedded Methods:\n",
    "The challenged we had in previous methods is that filters word with one feature, and wrapper selects a group of feature and then train the model from start to finish. The question is what if some features only present their power in some parameter space. Embedded methods are iterative in the sense that takes care of each iteration of the model training process and carefully extracts those features which contribute the most to the training for a particular iteration. They are also referred to as model based approaches as the features selected depends on the model.
